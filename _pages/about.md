I am a second year Ph.D. student  in
Electrical and Computer Engineering ([ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/)) department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
I am interested in Applied Probability and Statistics, 
especially in Complex Networks, Graph theory and Machine Learning.
I am advised by Prof. [Osman Yagan](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~oyagan/) at CMU ECE.

I obtained my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at CMU in December 2021,
and my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering department at Xi'an Jiaotong University in June 2019.
