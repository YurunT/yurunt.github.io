I am a Ph.D. candidate (third year) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 
My research interests span across _applied probability and statistics_ with a focus on 
_modeling_, _analysis_ and _learning_ for **networked systems**, to enhance the fundamental understanding of the underlying driven dynamics 
for phenomena of scientific and societal importance, 
deriving strategies to improve the cybersecurity measures in these systems, providing insights into downstream applications and tasks.

I am advised by Prof. Osman Yagan at CMU ECE and am a member of the [IDeaS Center](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/) at CMU. 
My work allows me the honor of collaborating with notable scholars such as [Chai Wah Wu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276424300) from [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/yorktown-heights), 
and [H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor) and [Simon A. Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/) from Princeton University.

I obtained my Master's degree at CMU ECE in December 2021, 
during which I feel extremely lucky to have worked with several amazing faculties at CMU: 
Prof. [Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/) from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/),
Prof. [Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html) from the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/), Prof. [Tze Meng Low](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/low-tze-meng.html) and Prof. [Hyong Kim](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kim-hyong.html) from the ECE Department.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering department at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2019.
I am grateful to be advised by Prof. [Rao Yuan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086952691) during my undergrad study.

In between my undergrad and master's study, I worked as Research Assistant on data-driven smart marketing and automation for [Thaibev](https://www.thaibev.com/th08/home.aspx) in Bangkok, Thailand for one year.
