I am a first year Ph.D. student of Complex Systems joint Computational Social Science in
Electrical and Computer Engineering ([ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/)) department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
I am co-advised by Prof. [Osman Yagan](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~oyagan/) (ECE, CMU) and Prof. [Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html) ([CS](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), CMU).
I am a member of the [CASOS](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/) group at [S3D](http://s3d.cmu.edu/), CMU.
My research focuses on the interdisciplinary intersections of complex networks, misinformation control and Deep Learning.

I obtained my Master's degree in ECE department at CMU in December 2021,
and my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering department at Xi'an Jiaotong University.
