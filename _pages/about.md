I am a second year Ph.D. student  in
Electrical and Computer Engineering ([ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/)) department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
I am interested in Applied Probability and Machine Learning, with a focus on networked systems.
I am advised by Prof. [Osman Yagan](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~oyagan/) at CMU ECE. 
I am also a member of the [IDeaS Center](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/) at CMU.
I am honored to collaborate with [Chai Wah Wu](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-cwwu) from IBM T. J. Watson Research Center and [H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor) and 
[Simon A. Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/) from Princeton University. 

I obtained my Master's degree at CMU ECE in December 2021, 
during which I feel extremely lucky to have worked with several amazing faculties at CMU: 
Prof. [Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/) from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/),
Prof. [Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html) from the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/), Prof. [Tze Meng Low](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/low-tze-meng.html) and Prof. [Hyong Kim](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kim-hyong.html) from the ECE Department.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering department at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2019.
I am grateful to be advised by Prof. [Rao Yuan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086952691) during my undergrad study.

In between my undergrad and master's study, I worked as Research Assistant on data-driven smart marketing and automation for [Thaibev](https://www.thaibev.com/th08/home.aspx) in Bangkok, Thailand for one year.

# About my research

[//]: # (I am fascinated by graphs. )

[//]: # (The violation of the iid assumption is what makes things harsh but also the most intriguing and powerful element.)
My current research focuses on an interdisciplinary field of graph theory, network science, complex systems, and dynamical processes, 
boosted by applied probability and statistics. 
The results generally shed lights on various scientific domains, such as computer algorithms (e.g., BFS over graphs, large components), 
robustness of large systems (with initial shocks), cascades in social and economic systems, network epidemics, etc.
I concentrate on the generic features of these phenomena (or systems) from a connected system perspective despite other physical mechanisms.
Fundamental findings on understanding of complex systems are derived, providing insights for decision-making and control strategies of downstream applications.
