In this paper, we propose a model of population heterogeneity over monoplex complex networks.
 We are the first to report an irregular but exciting case where the probability of an epidemic exhibits opposite trends with the epidemic size.
This result demonstrates that when considering mitigation strategies, we should keep two distinct phases in mind, rather than one as most literature suggests.
